# Project Details

You are redesigning the personal portfolio website for Arka Lal Chakravarty — an AI Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with a proven track record of building advanced AI SaaS products and automations.

❗Purpose of the Website:
To position Arka as a premium freelance/contract/full-time AI engineer and full-stack developer so that he can:

- Impress recruiters with his resume and past work
- Attract high-quality international clients
- Build a strong personal brand

❗The site is no longer an MVP agency site. It is a personal branding portfolio focused entirely on showcasing:

1. Who Arka is (bio, values, skills)
2. Projects built (with live demos and GitHub links)
3. Experience (past roles, freelance, current position)
4. Resume/CV downloadable and interactive
5. Tech stack & tools mastered
6. Client/testimonial quotes
7. Social presence and contact call-to-actions

The site should load fast, support SEO, and have smooth modern animations.

Target audience:

- International founders
- Startup recruiters (tech and AI)
- AI entrepreneurs
- Hiring managers in top product/startup companies
